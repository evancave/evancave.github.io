    <h3 class="fw-bold">About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a PhD student in philosophy at the University of British Columbia. My dissertation project defends a theory of normativity, according to which normativity is a disposition to affect how beings like us think and feel when we deliberate. Matt Bedke is my supervisor. </p>
    <p>My other interests concern how we should subdivide different normative domains, and the ontological relationships between different normative properties, like reasons and fittingness.</p>
